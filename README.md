#Preparing before starting the project
Before starting this project I did research about the aim of and the best aproach to take for a succesful submission for this very challenging project, so I used the resources to get a good feeling about the purpose of the project and best techniques to use, all resources that were viewed and used by me are listed below this page.


#Preprocessing the data
The data was resized to 64x64 format to make them smaller so the model could run faster, I also edited the format of the images to 64x64 in the drive.py file, to use the same format of the images when running. Next to this I splitted the data into train and validation sets and the images in both the train and validation datasets were normalized and shuffled. 


#Model structure
I decide to use the Keras Sequential model based on the NVIDIA model with 5 conventional layers and flatten, dropout and dense, this to optimize  


#Strategy
I decided to follow the advise of my mentor and other classmates to use the great dataset Udacity provided, the first runs oon my own generated data were not good at all. The Udacity dataset enabled me to build and tweak the best model possible to perform well on in the simulator, before using the Udacity dataset I took a look and noticed that some of the pictures looked somewhat nooisy and bumpy, this are some examples of pictures we had to keep in mind when pre prosessing the data before training our model:

#First run of the model
The first run of the model performed great using 10 EPOCH's and batch size 64, this resulted in: loss: 0.0128 - val_loss: 0.0111.
But I decided to tweak the model even more, but I also kept in mind that I had to be carefull not to overfit the model, thus this
would mean no good for driving the track. Also the Adam optimizer was used by me for Stochastic Optimization, to help the model perform well doing pattern recognition on the noisy dataset (The images) to get the lowest error possible.

#Tweaking the model
The parameters I tweaked a lot to get the best model with the lowest error score were: Number of EPOCH's and the Batch size of the train and validation data runs. The overview below shows the gains and losses the model suffered during tweaking it's parameters and the resulting loss & val_loss score, followed by the adjustments I made to optimize the the parameters of the model using the training datat to enable the car to perform best possible when using the output files to get the car running wel on the autonomus mode on the tracks in the simulator. When finished optimizing the model used 25 EPOCH's and a Batch size of 64, 

Using 10 EPOCH's with batch size 64 resulted in this valeus: 
Epoch 10/10 = 8064/8036 [==============================] - 44s - loss: 0.0128 - val_loss: 0.0111

Using 25 EPOCH's with batch size 64 resulted in even better results, both loss and val_loss were lower:
Epoch 25/25 = 8064/8036 [==============================] - 48s - loss: 0.0112 - val_loss: 0.0101

Using 75 EPOCH's with batch size 64  resulted in a lower loss, but higher val_loss:
Epoch 75/75 = 8064/8036 [==============================] - 42s - loss: 0.0103 - val_loss: 0.0111

Using 25 EPOCH's with batch size 128 resulted in the same loss as 25 EPOCH's with batch size 64, but a better vall_loss:
Epoch 25/25 = 8064/8036 [==============================] - 42s - loss: 0.0114 - val_loss: 0.0094

Using 25 EPOCH's with batch size 256 resulted in this values:
Epoch 25/25 = 8064/8036 [==============================] - 53s - loss: 0.0115 - val_loss: 0.0127

Final model parameters, using 25 EPOCH's and with a batch size of 64:
Epoch 25/25 = 8064/8036 [==============================] - 42s - loss: 0.0104 - val_loss: 0.0107
