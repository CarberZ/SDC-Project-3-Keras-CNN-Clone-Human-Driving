#Preparing before starting the project
Before starting this project I did research about the aim of and the best aproach to take for a succesful submission for this very challenging project, so I used the resources to get a good feeling about the purpose of the project and best techniques to use, all resources that were viewed and used by me are listed below this page.


#Preprocessing the data
The data was resized to 64 by 64 format to make them smaller to make the model run faster, 


#Model structure
I decide to use the Keras Sequential model with ... layers and ...., 


#Strategy
I decided to follow the advise of my mentor and other classmates to use the great data Udacity provided, this to get the best model possible to perform well on the track 1 in the simulator after opimizing the model to run the training data. 


#First run of the model
The first run of the model performed great using 10 EPOCH's and batch size 64, this resulted in: loss: 0.0128 - val_loss: 0.0111.
But I decided to tweak the model even more, but I also kept in mind that I had to be carefull not to overfit the model, thus this
would mean no good for driving the track.

#Tweaking the model
The parameters I tweaked were: Number of EPOCH's and the Batch sizes. 
This overview below shows the gains and losses the model suffered during tweaking it's parameters and the resulting loss & val_loss values, followed by the adjustments I made to optimize the the parameters of the model using the training datat to enable the car to perform best possible when running the drive.py file in the simulator.

Using 10 EPOCH's with batch size 64 resulted in this valeus: 
Epoch 10/10 = 8064/8036 [==============================] - 44s - loss: 0.0128 - val_loss: 0.0111


Using 25 EPOCH's with batch size 64 resulted in even better results, both loss and val_loss were lower:
Epoch 25/25 = 8064/8036 [==============================] - 48s - loss: 0.0112 - val_loss: 0.0101


Using 75 EPOCH's with batch size 64  resulted in a lower loss, but higher val_loss:
Epoch 75/75 = 8064/8036 [==============================] - 42s - loss: 0.0103 - val_loss: 0.0111


Using 25 EPOCH's with batch size 128 resulted in the same loss as 25 EPOCH's with batch size 64, but a better vall_loss:
Epoch 25/25 = 8064/8036 [==============================] - 42s - loss: 0.0114 - val_loss: 0.0094


Using 25 EPOCH's with batch size 256 resulted in this values:
Epoch 25/25 = 8064/8036 [==============================] - 53s - loss: 0.0115 - val_loss: 0.0127


I decided to run the model Using 25 EPOCH's with batch size 64:
Epoch 25/25 = 8064/8036 [==============================] - 42s - loss: 0.0104 - val_loss: 0.0107
